# NuGet Package Popularity Tracker

This Azure Functions project runs hourly to log total download count for certain NuGet packages. After running for an extended period of time these log files can be plotted to reveal trends in NuGet package popularity over time.

This project started running at midnight on 2020-06-24, so some back later to see how it turns out...
